Final Project: Rust Word Counter - A Parallelism Study
Description:
In final project, you need to develop a Rust-based word counting application with a focus on parallelism techniques. The project should be implemented in sequential, task parallelism, and pipeline parallelism using the actor model to showcase the capabilities of Rust in handling concurrent and parallel workloads. Furthermore, the project will involve extensive commenting to explain each implementation's inner workings, as clarity and understanding will be essential for grading.
Project Goals:

    Use three text files, each with a size of at least 10 KB, as input data for the word counting application.(any files)
    Count the number of occurrences of the word "the" in each of the text files.
    Implement three different versions of the word counting application: a. Sequential processing b. Task parallelism c. Pipeline parallelism using the actor model
    Measure the performance of each version and compare the results.
    Provide clear and concise comments explaining how each implementation works, including details on the parallelism techniques and Rust-specific features used.

Grading Criteria:
The final grade for the project will be based on:

    Code Compilation: The application must compile successfully without any errors.
    Correctness: The application should provide accurate results for the number of occurrences of the word "the" in each of the text files.
    Comment Quality: The provided comments must be clear, concise, and informative, effectively explaining how each implementation works and the parallelism techniques used.
    Performance Comparison: A clear comparison of the performance of each version (sequential, task parallelism, and pipeline parallelism) must be presented, demonstrating the benefits and trade-offs of each approach.


P.S Refer to the lecture notes. On Parallelizm it contains all starter code as well as examples of each paradigm.
P.S.S Final project is 25 % of your final grade. Be mindful.
P.S.S.S Submission format, screenshot and link to your repl. so that I can run it as well. and see your text files.
Deadline is 10 May 2023
